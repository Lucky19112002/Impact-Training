    "There is a mess in the parcel section of the Head Office. The parcels that have to be loaded in the vans are lined up in a row randomly. The Head Post Master wants them to order them in the increasing order of their weights, but he wants to keep the heaviest (and presumably the most valuable) parcel nearest to his office.\n",
    "You and your friend try to arrange these boxes, and you decide to arrange them by interchanging two boxes at a time. Such replacement needs effort equal to the product of the weights of the two boxes which are exchanged.Â \n",

    "The second line contains N space-separated positive integers, i.e., the weights of the boxes. Assume that no two weights are equal.\n"
