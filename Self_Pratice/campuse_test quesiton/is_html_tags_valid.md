## HTML Tag Validation Code Explanation

### Function Definition: `is_html_tags_valid(html)`

This function takes an HTML string (`html`) as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the HTML tags in the input string are properly opened and closed.

### Initialization: `stack = []`

An empty list called `stack` is initialized. This list acts as a stack data structure to keep track of open tags.

### Loop: `while i < len(html):`

The code enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input HTML string.

### Checking for Tag Start: `if html[i] == '<':`

If the current character is an opening angle bracket `<`, it indicates the start of a tag.

### Finding Tag Name: `j = i + 1` and `while j < len(html) and html[j] != '>':`

We start searching for the end of the tag by incrementing `j` until we find the closing angle bracket `>`. This helps us extract the tag name.

### Extracting Tag Name: `tag = html[i + 1:j]`

After finding the end of the tag, we extract the tag name by slicing the HTML string between `i + 1` and `j`.

### Checking for Closing Tag: `if tag.startswith('/'):`

If the extracted tag starts with a `/`, it indicates a closing tag. We need to check if this closing tag corresponds to the most recent opening tag.

### Checking Corresponding Opening Tag: `if not stack or stack[-1] != tag[1:]:`

If the stack is empty or the most recent opening tag in the stack is not the corresponding opening tag for the current closing tag, then the HTML is invalid.

### Popping from Stack (Closing Tag): `stack.pop()`

If the current closing tag corresponds to the most recent opening tag, we pop the opening tag from the stack as it has been properly closed.

### Pushing to Stack (Opening Tag): `stack.append(tag)`

If the tag is not a closing tag, we assume it's an opening tag and push it onto the stack.

### Incrementing Index: `i = j`

After handling the tag, we move the index `i` to the end of the processed tag.

### Handling Non-Tag Characters: `else:`

If the current character is not an opening angle bracket, we increment the index `i`.

### Checking Stack Empty: `return len(stack) == 0`

After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all tags were properly closed, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Taking User Input and Displaying Output:

- The code prompts the user to input an HTML string.
- It then calls the `is_html_tags_valid` function and prints "Output: yes" if the HTML tags are valid, and "Output: no" if they are not.
