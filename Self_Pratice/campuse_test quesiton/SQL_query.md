## Explanation of SQL Query

This SQL query is designed to retrieve specific information from a hypothetical `employee_data` table, providing insights into employee supervision and demographics.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    ReportTo,
    COUNT(*) AS member_count,
    AVG(age) AS average_age
FROM 
    employee_data
WHERE 
    ReportTo IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    ReportTo
ORDER BY 
    ReportTo ASC;

Explanation
SELECT Clause: This section defines the columns to be displayed in the query's output.

ReportTo: Represents the supervisor's identifier.
COUNT(*) AS member_count: Computes the number of employees in each supervisor group and labels it as member_count.
AVG(age) AS average_age: Calculates the average age of employees in each supervisor group and labels it as average_age.
FROM Clause: Specifies the source table for data retrieval.

employee_data: Refers to the table where employee information is stored.
WHERE Clause: Filters rows before performing calculations.

ReportTo IS NOT NULL: Ensures that only rows with non-NULL ReportTo values (employees with supervisors) are included in calculations.
GROUP BY Clause: Segments the data for aggregation.

ReportTo: Groups rows based on unique supervisor identifiers (ReportTo values).
ORDER BY Clause: Sorts the output data.

ReportTo ASC;: Arranges the results in ascending order based on supervisor identifiers.
Example
Consider the following hypothetical employee_data table:

employee_id	employee_name	age	ReportTo
1	        John	        30	3
2	        Alice	        28	3
3	        Michael	        35	5
4	        Emily	        29	5
5	        David	        40	NULL
6	        Sophia	        31	5
For the provided SQL query, the output will be:

ReportTo	member_count	average_age
3	        2	            29
5	        3	            35.3333
This output indicates the number of employees under each supervisor, excluding those with NULL supervisors. It also provides the average age of employees under each supervisor, with results sorted by supervisor identifier in ascending order.

In summary, the SQL query extracts valuable insights from the employee_data table, offering a breakdown of employee counts and average ages under each supervisor's management.
