1. **Function Definition**:
   - The code defines a function named `capitalize_first_letters` that accepts an `input_string` as a parameter.
   
2. **Splitting the Input**:
   - The `input_string` is split into a list of words using the `split()` method. This creates a list called `words`.

3. **Capitalization of Words**:
   - A list comprehension iterates through each `word` in the `words` list.
   - The `capitalize()` method is applied to each `word`, making the first letter uppercase and the rest lowercase.
   - The resulting capitalized words are stored in the `capitalized_words` list.

4. **Joining Capitalized Words**:
   - The `capitalized_words` list is joined into a single string using the `join()` method.
   - A space character is used as the separator, creating the `output_string`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - The `output_string` is returned by the `capitalize_first_letters` function.
   
6. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to input a string using `input()`, and the entered text is stored in the `input_string` variable.
   
7. **Function Call and Output**:
   - The `capitalize_first_letters` function is called with `input_string` as an argument.
   - The result is the capitalized version of the input string, stored in the `output_string` variable.
   
8. **Displaying Output**:
   - The capitalized string in `output_string` is displayed to the user using `print()`, preceded by the message "Output:".
